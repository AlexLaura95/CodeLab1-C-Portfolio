Module: CodeLab I C++ 10 coding programs Portfolio 
Exercise: 04 â€“ Primitive Quiz  

Description:  
---------------------------
This a sample of a readme.txt file for one of my programs.  It is a simple country-capital quiz.  This program is a simple country-capital quiz. It asks the user the capital of 10 countries and checks the answers. Each response is validated and a message is printed whether it is correct or not.

How it Works: 
--------------------------- 
- Arrays are used to store 10 countries and their capitals.
- A for-loop runs 10 times, asking a question each time.
- The user types an answer using `cin`, and it's compared to the stored capital.
- Output is given based on correctness.
- Program ends after 10 rounds.

Programming Concepts Used: 
--------------------------- 
- Sequencing  
- Iteration (for-loop)  
- Selection (if-else)  
- Arrays  
- User input/output  

Suggested Improvements:  
---------------------------
- Add score tracking  
- Make input case-insensitive  
- Shuffle questions for randomness  

Compilation Instructions:  
---------------------------
g++ 04_primitive_quiz.cpp -o primitive_quiz.exe  
./primitive_quiz.exe

Learning Outcome:
---------------------------
My introduction to programming happened in Scratch Blocks and getting myself to get to know with Python, both of were important in my 
progress for programming in C++. Scratch was nice and basic to me so that I could see beyond the programming world with logic and flow 
that was visual programming blocks of code. No longer did programming seem a big problem. I could grasp the concept of following a sequence 
of instructions and of decisions and repetitions.  C++ was my first experience with a programming language. I was able to work with variables, 
functions, loops, and conditionals in a very straightforward way for my beginners level. This helped me to understand the essence of programming 
and learn good coding programming habits such as writing clean, understandable code and thinking logically about how to solve problems exactly 
like a programmer does.  I started with the sololearn.com, for basic C++.  It is true that C++ is hard because having to learn new syntax.  But 
it was the same ideas that I had known before, making my crossing over much easier. For instance, the implementation of arrays, handling user input,
and writing if statements or for loops were all extensions of what I had done in Python before. While working on these ten assignments on 
Visual Studio Code, my knowledge skills in writing, testing, and debugging C++ programs. I discovered how to implement control structures, 
handle various data types, and organise my code for clearer and more efficient way to coding. I have practiced logical reasoning to analyse problems
and lessons in a sequencing, iteration and selections, this was a good learning path and a good experience for me.  Doing C++ has 
enriched my technical competencies, also given me confidence to face even the more complicated coding projects in future assignments.
